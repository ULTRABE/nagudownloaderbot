# 🍪 Cookie Setup Guide - NAGU DOWNLOADER BOT

> **⚠️ No longer used by the downloader.** As of this change, `downloaders/instagram.py` and
> `downloaders/youtube.py` download directly — no proxy, no cookies — for speed and to stop depending on
> credentials that go stale or leak. Cookie files placed per this guide are simply not read anymore. This
> is a deliberate trade-off: public content (the vast majority of requests) downloads fine without
> cookies; private accounts, age-restricted, or sign-in-walled content will now fail instead of succeeding
> via a cookie fallback. See `SCALING.md` for the reasoning. Don't "helpfully" re-wire cookies back in
> without re-reading that trade-off first — the whole point was to remove this dependency.

## 🎯 Why Cookie Rotation?

**Problem**: YouTube flags cookies after 1-2 downloads (bot detection)

**Solution**: Rotate between 5-6 different cookie files
- Each download uses a random cookie file
- Spreads requests across multiple accounts
- Avoids flagging

---

## 📝 How to Export Cookies

**Chrome/Edge**:
- [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc)

- [cookies.txt](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/)

### 2. Export YouTube Cookies (5-6 accounts)

For each YouTube account:
1. Login to youtube.com
2. Click extension icon
3. Export cookies
4. Save as `yt_cookie_1.txt`, `yt_cookie_2.txt`, etc.
5. Place in `yt_cookies/` folder

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

## 🔄 Cookie Rotation Logic

### YouTube Videos:
```python
# Tries random cookie from yt_cookies/ folder
cookie_file = get_random_cookie("yt_cookies")
```

### MP3 Search:
```python
# Tries random cookie from yt_music_cookies/ folder
cookie_file = get_random_cookie("yt_music_cookies")
```

### Instagram:
```python
# Uses single cookies_instagram.txt file
# Only as fallback (tries without cookies first)
```

---

## 📊 Expected Results

With 5-6 cookies per folder:
- **No flagging** (requests spread across accounts)
- **Fast downloads** (no delays needed)
- **High success rate** (multiple fallbacks)
- **Sustainable** (cookies last longer)

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### Railway:

1. Create folders:
   ```bash
   mkdir yt_cookies yt_music_cookies
   ```

2. Add cookie files to folders

3. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard:
   - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
   - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`

4. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add cookie folders"
   git push
   ```

5. Railway auto-deploys

---

## ✅ Verification

Bot startup logs should show:
```
NAGU DOWNLOADER BOT - STARTING
Semaphore: 16 concurrent downloads
Proxies: 6
YT cookies: 6 files
YT Music cookies: 6 files
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "No cookies found"
- Check folder names are exact: `yt_cookies` and `yt_music_cookies`
- Check files have `.txt` extension
- Check files are in Netscape format

### "Still getting flagged"
- Add more cookie files (8-10 per folder)
- Use different Google accounts
- Add delays between requests

### "Spotify not working"
- Check environment variables are set
- Verify Client ID and Secret are correct
- Check spotdl is installed
